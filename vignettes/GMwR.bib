  journal = {Hepatology},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {45},
  pages = {767--777},

  abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is a
	major transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. It is activated
	by diverse chemicals such as fatty acids (FAs) and regulates the
	expression of numerous genes in organs displaying high FA catabolic
	rates, including the liver. The role of this nuclear receptor as
	a sensor of whole dietary fat intake has been inferred, mostly from
	high-fat diet studies. To delineate its function under low fat intake
	conditions (4.8\% w/w), we studied the effects of five regimens with
	contrasted FA compositions on liver lipids and hepatic gene expression
	in wild-type and PPARalpha-deficient mice. Diets containing polyunsaturated
	FAs reduced hepatic fat stores in wild-type mice. Only sunflower,
	linseed, and fish oil diets lowered hepatic lipid stores in PPARalpha-/-
	mice, a model of progressive hepatic triglyceride accumulation. These
	beneficial effects were associated, in particular, with dietary regulation
	of Delta9-desaturase in both genotypes, and with a newly identified
	PPARalpha-dependent regulation of lipin. Furthermore, hepatic levels
	of 18-carbon essential FAs (C18:2omega6 and C18:3omega3) were elevated
	in PPARalpha-/- mice, possibly due to the observed reduction in expression
	of the Delta6-desaturase and of enoyl-coenzyme A isomerases. Effects
	of diet and genotype were also observed on the xenobiotic metabolism-related
	genes Cyp3a11 and CAR. CONCLUSION: Together, our results suggest
	that dietary FAs represent--even under low fat intake conditions--a
	beneficial strategy to reduce hepatic steatosis. Under such conditions,
	we established the role of PPARalpha as a dietary FA sensor and highlighted
	its importance in regulating hepatic FA content and composition.},

  abstract = {For rectangular confidence regions for the mean values of multivariate
	normal distributions the following conjecture of O. J. Dunn [3],
	[4] is proved: Such a confidence region constructed for the case
	of independent coordinates is, at the same time, a conservative confidence
	region for any case of dependent coordinates. This result is based
	on an inequality for the probabilities of rectangles in normal distributions,
	which permits one to factor out the probability for any single coordinate.},

  abstract = {Previous asymptotically correct algorithms for recovering causal structure
	from sample probabilities have been limited even in sparse causal
	graphs to a few variables. We describe an asymptotically correct
	algorithm whose complexity for fixed graph connectivity increases
	polynomially in the number of vertices, and may in practice recover
	sparse graphs with several hundred variables. From sample data with
	n = 20,000, an implementation of the algorithm on a DECStation 3100
	recovers the edges in a linear version of the ALARM network with
	37 vertices and 46 edges. Fewer than 8% of the undirected edges are
	incorrectly identified in the output. Without prior ordering information,
	the program also determines the direction of edges for the ALARM
	graph with an error rate of 14%. Processing time is less than 10
	seconds. Keywords DAGS, Causal Modelling.},
