\title{Milk composition data}
\format{
A data frame with 214 observations on the following 7 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{sow}}{a numeric vector}
\item{\code{lactime}}{a numeric vector}
\item{\code{treat}}{a factor with levels \code{a} \code{b} \code{c} \code{d} \code{e} \code{f} \code{g}}
\item{\code{fat}}{a numeric vector}
\item{\code{protein}}{a numeric vector}
\item{\code{dm}}{(dry matter) a numeric vector}
\item{\code{lactose}}{a numeric vector}
}
}
\usage{
data(milkcomp)
}
\description{
Data from an experiment on composition of sow milk. Milk composition is
measured on four occasions during lactation on a number of sows. The
treatments are different types of fat added to the sows feed.
}
\details{
\code{a} is the control, i.e. no fat has been added.

\code{fat} + \code{protein} + \code{lactose} almost add up to \code{dm} (dry
matter)
}
\examples{

data(milkcomp)
## maybe str(milk) ; plot(milk) ...
