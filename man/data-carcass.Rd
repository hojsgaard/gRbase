\title{Lean meat contents of 344 pig carcasses}
\format{
carcassall: A data frame with 344 observations on the following 17
variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{weight}}{Weight of carcass}
\item{\code{lengthc}}{Length of carcass from back toe to head (when
the carcass hangs in the back legs)}
\item{\code{lengthf}}{Length of carcass from back toe to front leg
(that is, to the shoulder)}
\item{\code{lengthp}}{Length of carcass from back toe to the pelvic bone}
\item{\code{Fat02, Fat03, Fat11, Fat12, Fat13, Fat14, Fat16}}{Thickness of fat
layer at different locations on the back of the carcass (FatXX
refers to thickness at (or rather next to) rib no. XX. Notice that
02 is closest to the head}
\item{\code{Meat11, Meat12, Meat13}}{Thickness of meat layer at different
locations on the back of the carcass, see description above}
\item{\code{LeanMeat}}{Lean meat percentage determined by dissection}
\item{\code{slhouse}}{Slaughter house; a factor with levels \code{a} \code{b} \code{c}}
\item{\code{sex}}{Sex of the pig; a factor with \code{a} \code{b}
\code{c}. Notice that it is no an error to have three levels; the
third level refers to castrates}
