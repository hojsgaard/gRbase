gRbase v1.9.0 (Release date: 2023-08-20)
==========================================

Changes:

* Major change: This package as well as gRain and gRim no longer makes
  use of the bioconductor packages graph, RBGL and Rgraphviz whence
  installation of gRbase has become simpler. Graphs are handled with
  the igraph package and there are also some graph algorithms
  implemented in gRbase.  This implies that functions like dag() and
  ug() returns "igraph" objects by default

* LazyData: true added to DESCRIPTION


gRbase v1.8.9 (Release date: 2022-11-01)
==========================================

Changes:

  * tabNew modified to a more consistent behaviour

  * biocViews removed again; did not fix Bioconductor dependency issue.


gRbase v1.8.8 (Release date: 2022-10-16)
==========================================

Changes:

  * Added biocViews: graph,RBGL,Rgraphviz to DESCRIPTION file. Seemes to fix Bioconductor dependency issue.

  * Changed files to utf-8


gRbase v1.8.7 (Release date: 2022-02-12)
==========================================

Changes:

  * More imports from graph

  * Updated data descriptions

  * Various bugs fixed

  * tabDist has been enhanced

  * fixed RcppEigen issue raised by Dirk E



gRbase v1.8-6.7 (Release date: 2020-06-28)
==========================================

Changes:

  * doi's added to description file.
  
  * Some old c-code (from Bristol) removed and replaced by more readable c++ code.

  * combn_prim reimplemented in cpp. Not quite as fast as the
    original, but new implementation provides identical results to combn

  * fastcombn added. Intended to be faster version of combn.


gRbase v1.8-6.6 (Release date: 2020-06-14)
==========================================

Bug fixes

  * tab_expand_ fixed and expanded to take arguement describing how
    expansiion should bed made.

  * list based coercion functions fixed to work with empty lists

  * fixed minor bug in graph coercion.

Other changes:

  * matrix2list changed to take MARGIN argument
  

gRbase v1.8-5.3 (Release date: 2020-02-18)
==========================================

Bug fixes:

  * Even more functions are exported (changed from manually generated
    to automatically generated NAMESPACE file; this has caused
    downstream trouble.

Other changes:

  * More tests added Would like to use snake_case rather than
  * camelCase in function names, but this causes too much trouble to
  * change downstream so we accept dual names for some functions for now.

gRbase v1.8-5.2 (Release date: 2020-02-06)
==========================================

Bug fixes:

  * More functiones are exported

Other changes:

  * NEWS file added
  * NAMESPACE file is now generated automatically
  * Cleaning up experimental features
  * Added testthat (not very comprehensive tests, though)
